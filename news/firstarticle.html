              <h2>New Surrey City Hall Accesses Review</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Surrey City Hall was moved from 56th Avenue to the new venue in the Surrey City Centre area on 104th Avenue in late February 2014.  Immediate to the south of the new location is the new Surrey Library and they share the same underground parkade.  Currently, two of the three accesses to the three level parkade are opened to the public. WILDES Consulting Inc. was requested to undertake a traffic conflict review at the two new driveway accesses and provide recommendations for any immediate improvements necessary. The report was submitted to the City in March 2014.</p>
